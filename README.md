Step 1: Installed the Ubuntu on VMplayer 7.
Step 2: Configured Mongo Mapper with Ruby on Rails.
Step 3: Uploaded the data On MongoDB.
Step 4: Used jQuery at the frond side to display the data to the browser.
Step 5: Made 100 Ajax style request to server side framework.
Step 6: Set time interval of 0.5 sec using setInterval() method.
Step 7: Each request loaded single record from the database.
Step 8: Modified web page to display the datafrom each record.

Step 9: Bonus Part: 1. Added animation to display the newly arriving data.
		    2. Displayed only 20 records at a time by using the .limit(2) method on MongoDb collection.

Answer to question 4:
1) Configuration of MongoDB with rails was easy because i found the documentation on MOngoDB which explained clearly how to configure mongo with rails.
2) Adding animation was difficult for me because i did not know how to add the animation on newly arrived data. So, this take extra time for me
3)If I would have to use this technology proffesionaly, the version problem in ruby will be my biggest concern because sometime mongo doesn't work in rails 4.
